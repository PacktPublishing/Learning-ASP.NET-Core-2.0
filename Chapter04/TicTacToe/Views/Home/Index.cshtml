            <p>Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player turn-based game.</p>
            <p>Two players will choose who takes the Xs and who takes the Os. They will then be taking turns and mark spaces in a 3×3 grid by putting their marks, one mark per turn.</p>
            <p>A player who succeeds in placing three of his marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.</p>
